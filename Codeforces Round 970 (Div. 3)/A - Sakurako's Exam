/*
LOGIC---
think about 2,2 => YES

The only condition when ans is NO => a is odd or, when (a is 0 and b is odd)
Otherwise, the aNswer is always YES

PROOF---
When a is even.
a => a/2 -> +1 and a/2 -> -1

Subcase: b is even=> b/2 ->+2 and b/2 -> -2 => hence 1's handles themselves and 2's handles themselves
Subcase: b is odd => b/2 ->+2 and b/2-> -2, In such a scenario an extra 2 is left.
Thankfully, since our freq of 1 is not 0 and even. We can transfer one of the +1 to -1, making it -2 to tackle the extra +2 dropped from the odd occurences of 2.
