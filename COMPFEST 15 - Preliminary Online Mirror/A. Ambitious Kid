/* LOGIC---
We need to make product of array zero.
Each step is increasing or decreasing a vlaue by 1.
So, we will choose the element that is closest to zero and make it 0 by decreasing or increasing it by one, which will be the absolute of value itself.
Since we are decreasing or increasing by one. 
In actuality we need the smallest positive integer or zero itself.

The answer is the MINIMUM(absolute differnce between the elemnts and zero)
