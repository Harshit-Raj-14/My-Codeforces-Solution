LOGIC ---
Formula sandwhich - cheese/ham - bread
1 JUMBOsandwhich = 1 bread+1fill+1bread+1ham+....+1bread
1 sandwhich = 1bread+1fill
1JUMBO=2*sandwhich+1bread = no. of layers

So, let's find no of sandwhich we can make
for 1 cheese/ham = 1 bread on top
1 bread at bottom is itself the top of next (except for the last bread at bottom)
cheese = ham = filling


/* O(1) SOLUTION */
LOGIC ---
Notice that the type of filling doesn't matter. We can treat both cheese and ham together as one filling, with quantity c+h

Then let's start building a sandwich layer by layer. Put a piece of bread. Then put a layer of filling and a piece of bread. 
Then another layer of filling and a piece of bread. Observe that you can add one layer of filling and one piece of bread until one of them runs out. 
After you've done that k times, you placed k+1 layers of bread and k layers of filling.

Thus, there are two general cases. If bread runs out first, then k=b−1. Otherwise, k=c+h.
The one that runs out first is the smaller of these two values. So the answer is min(b−1,c+h)

Overall complexity: O(1)
