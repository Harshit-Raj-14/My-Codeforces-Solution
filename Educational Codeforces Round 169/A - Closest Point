/*
LOGIC---
In a sorted array, the previus element or the next elemnt can be the enarest possible.

We need to find an element which is nearest to every element in array.

Now it will only possible when there are two elements.

For more thna 2 elements it will never be possible.

Now even when in two elements: if the nearest point is at distance 1. We cant have an existing element between them.

 => since no nearest points other than that can exist and it is already present in array.
